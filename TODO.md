## Simplify
- Worktree setup as a script — run a committed `.worktree-setup` instead of parsing `## Worktree setup` from AGENTS.md; the parser drew 5 of 17 run-worktrees findings

## Review deferrals
- `jflow-config`: Unsupported flags or invalid `--session` values can echo key-like text in stderr; nothing is recorded. The human kept this existing behavior on 2026-11-08.
- `receipt-evidence-cap`: Measure the next three trial runs. Every Evidence cell and defect `Evidence:` part must be at most 240 characters, and each receipt under 3 KB.
- `receipt-evidence-cap`: Decide whether an escaped pipe counts as one or two characters toward the evidence cap. Counting stays unspecified at close.
